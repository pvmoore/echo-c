- Always access member functions using the name() syntax rather than just name without brackets.

- Functions should usually have a comment above them that includes information about the
    parameters and return value. Use the following template as an example:

```d
/**
 * Function description.
 *
 * @param paramName Description of the parameter
 * @return Description of the return value
 */
 ```
